- Displays a random recipe with an image, title, and instructions.
- Stylish and responsive design with animations for a better user experience.
- Built with TypeScript for improved type safety and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality to display the recipe dynamically.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.

## TypeScript

This project uses TypeScript to enhance the JavaScript codebase. TypeScript provides type safety and helps catch errors during development, leading to more robust and maintainable code. Key aspects include:

- **Type Annotations**: TypeScript allows us to annotate variables, function parameters, and return types, ensuring that the values used in the code conform to expected types.
- **Interfaces**: We use interfaces to define the structure of objects, such as the recipe data, which improves code readability and robustness.
- **Static Type Checking**: TypeScript performs type checking at compile time, helping to identify potential issues before running the code.

To compile TypeScript files into JavaScript, the `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler) command is used. The resulting JavaScript files are then used in the web application.
